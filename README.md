🛡️ Learning Spring Security – Day 1 (08/07/2025)
Goal: Improve the security layer of my Skill Swap project using Spring Security.

Topics Covered:

✅ What is Spring Security?

✅ Why do we need it in real-world applications?

✅ Understanding CSRF and CSRF Tokens

✅ Session ID and how sessions maintain login state

✅ SecurityContext and SecurityContextHolder

✅ In-Memory Authentication setup

Reflection:
Today was eye-opening! I didn’t just learn technical terms — I learned how real-world backend attacks happen and how Spring Security acts as a shield.
Every concept makes me feel more confident about building secure applications.
