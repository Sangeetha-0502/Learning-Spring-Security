## Goal: Improve the security layer of my Skill Swap project using Spring Security.
### 🛡️ Learning Spring Security – Day 1 (08/07/2025)
#### Topics Covered:
✅ What is Spring Security?

✅ Why do we need it in real-world applications?

✅ Understanding CSRF and CSRF Tokens

✅ Session ID and how sessions maintain login state

✅ SecurityContext and SecurityContextHolder

✅ In-Memory Authentication setup

#### Reflection:
Today was eye-opening! I didn’t just learn technical terms — I learned how real-world backend attacks happen and how Spring Security acts as a shield.
Every concept makes me feel more confident about building secure applications.

### 🛡️ Learning Spring Security – Day 2 (09/07/2025)
#### Topics Covered:
✅ How Spring Security uses UserDetails and UserDetailsService to represent and load user data

✅ Implementing In-Memory Authentication using InMemoryUserDetailsManager

✅ Defining custom users with roles like ADMIN

✅ Creating a custom SecurityFilterChain

✅ Disabling CSRF token for development/testing

✅ What is PasswordEncoder and why we need to encode passwords

✅ Login and logout flows using Spring Boot's default form

✅ Common mistake debugging (e.g., login issues, invalid credentials, role mapping)

#### Reflection:
Today felt like leveling up! I learned how Spring Security knows "who I am" and "what I can access" through UserDetails and roles.
I also built my first custom security filter chain, learned how password encoding works, and started experimenting with login/logout behavior.

One of the biggest takeaways was:

Even though CSRF protection is important, we can disable it while testing to focus on building and understanding authentication first.
